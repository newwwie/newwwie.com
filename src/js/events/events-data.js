      "description": "The Talk\n\nAs kids we loved playing computer games. Today, many people pickup speedrunning to continue to enjoy and relive that experience, while entertaining millions of people globally. Finishing games quickly is an intensely competitive field, and while initially a lot of focus was on optimising movement and routing, we are seeing novel data-analysis techniques applied to optimise speedruns. This talk will cover how we use aggregation, data-science, entropic analysis, and more to speed up games like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Final Fantasy 6, and more!\n\nThe Speaker\n\nCole Cornford is the Director of Galah Cyber, an Australian Cybersecurity consultancy with a focus on Application, Cloud, and Product Security. Cole has worked in the security space for 8 years across a variety of industries and cybersecurity fields.

      "title": "NCSG, July 2022 | Andrew Stace",
      "description": "Hello friends! Welcome back to another instalment of NCSG.\n\nThis month, we're lucky to have Andrew Stace, the fearless leader and founder of our lovely group. He currently works as a cybersecurity professional for an ASX-listed company, and the grand finale of his presentation will be him 100%ing a variety of songs on Beat Saber.\n\nSynopsis of Andrew's talk:\n\nCybersecurity scams are increasing in frequency & impact. Meaning that more people than ever before are coming to be impacted by some form of cyber crime.\n\nBut often our attention is focused on the impact being described in financial or technical framings. Instead, in this talk, Andrew will explore some of the emotional impact of cybercrime &/or the emotional context(s) in which it can prosper.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: July 28th, 2022\nTime: 18:00-20:00ish (or until we go to the pub)\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor 'seminar space'\nFood: Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Thursday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\nWant to learn more?
