      "description": "The Women and Gender Diverse People in Tech are continuing our speaker series in October! Our speaker this month is Arden Cassie!\n\nArden Cassie (she/her) found a home working in the tech sector in 2018 after leaving the education sector. Growing up in a tight Christian community she was never going to be able to come out quietly. Since 2019 she has been a proud advocate for gender diverse people in the Hunter region working with Hunter Gender Alliance.\n\nHunter Gender Alliance brings together trans and gender diverse people, parents of trans young people and medical professionals to build community and improve both physical and mental health outcomes.\n\nWhilst she is currently teaching mathematics, tech is always close by. Arden is the Vice President for Hunter Gender Alliance and can be found performing as a musician in Newcastle.\n\nArden will be sharing part of her personal journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and self-affirmation. She will also share what it means to be a gender diverse person, what allyship looks like, and how to create safe spaces for trans and gender diverse people.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nWe'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 24 Lindus Street, Wickham for this event.\n\nThere will be pizza and refreshments provided. Please let Arden or Sarah know of any dietaries you have beforehand.",
