Once again, we're bringing the Newcastle tech community together for Newwwie Tech Trivia.\nKlee will go curate a list of questions that will be humorous, challenging and esoteric. You can expect questions on the news from the last year, tech history, among some edge case programming questions reminiscent of bad job interviews.\n\nOur venue will be the Camplify / NTP Office. We'll have plenty of food, drinks and prizes thanks to our sponsors, Saphi Engineering, Galah Cyber and Newy Tech People.\n\nThis is a team-based game, come with a team pre-formed or find one on the day. In past years our best teams have been people who happened to sit at a table together.\n\nWe'll have 3 rounds, each with their own prizes so if you need to arrive late or leave early, that's OK.\n\nDoors will open from 6:00 with drinks, food and time to find a team.\nThe first round starts at around 6:45.\n\nThis is an in-person only event.",
