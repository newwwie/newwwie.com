There is no set agenda, you can arrive and leave when you please, and dinner and drinks are optional (but at your own expense).\n\nThe Honeysuckle Hotel is where we usually go after our events at the university's Q Building. There is no booking but we will try and gather some tables.\n\nIf you can't find us, call out in the [Newwwie Slack #data-science channel](https://newwwie.slack.com/archives/CBD021X0U) and we'll direct you.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nWhen: Thursday 19th of October 5.30pm-8.30pm\n\nWhere: The Honeysuckle Hotel, Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle",

      "description": "G'day all! This month we have Cole Cornford giving a repeat of his keynote presentation from the Australian Parliament House Cyber Conference.\n\nCole is a Galah.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nIn 2011, Marc Andreessen wrote that “Software is eating the world”. Well, 12 years later it has truly eaten it. Digital offerings are the minimum expectation for government services. Citizens want clear and optimised processes. They want convenience. They want trusted and resilient platforms. The APS is building a lot of software to meet these demands. But security remains a thorny challenge.\nCybersecurity continues to be driven by compliance, reactive in nature, and at odds with building great digital experiences. But it doesn’t need to be, and that’s where Application Security programs come in. Join Cole as he discusses the options available for governments to pursue to enable high-velocity software engineering while keeping our citizens safe.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** October 25th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - bottom floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?
