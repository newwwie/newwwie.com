      "description": "We're back for 2023!\nTo start out the year we'll have Tom Howard from Digizoo speaking about working in fire teams.\n\nWe'll be at the MudBath office in Newcastle. There will be pizza provided for dinner and a range of beer, wine and soft drinks provided.\n\nThe run sheet for the night is:\n5:45 pm Doors open\n6:20 pm Tech news (open floor)\n6:30 pm Tom Howard - Fireteams of Awesome!\n7:30 pm Dinner, drinks, and discussions\n\n**Talk Abstract:**\nThe structure of traditional IT teams is heavily influenced by Fred Taylor's \"Scientific Management\" from over 100 years ago. While this approach revolutionised manufacturing, it is fundamentally unsuited to creative work like software delivery. *Fireteams of awesomeness* examines the issues encountered with traditional IT structures, why this issues occur and how these issues are solved using a collaborative Fireteam approach. Finally *Fireteams of awesomeness* looks at over 3 years of empirical data to compare Fireteams with traditional IT teams, showing a 400% increase in throughput, with higher team moral, higher stakeholder satisfaction and higher quality. Sweet!\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\nTom is a software delivery coach at Digizoo. He started out as a C++ developer over 20 years ago. Since then his focus has moved primarily from solving technical delivery problems, to solving people and organisational delivery problems, by understanding and leveraging our individual and team biases and heuristics.",

      "description": "The Women and Gender Diverse People in Tech meeting starts back for 2023 in February! We're super excited about all the amazing speakers this year. February's speaker is Justine Ulph!\n\nJustine Ulph is the Clean Energy Manager at Port of Newcastle. Justine is passionate about work that is grounded in regional development. Justine has worked across health and medicine, energy, resources, and agriculture sectors. Their role at the Port of Newcastle as Clean Energy Manager is dynamic and fast-paced, supporting an ambitious agenda to diversify the Port of Newcastle. Prior to joining PON Justine worked in early-stage development of HMRI and NIER at the University of Newcastle. In 1998, they established a fundraising arm of HMRI to support early career researchers.\n\nOutside of work, Justine is adventurous - they have crossed the Bass Strait twice sailing in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. Typically, when not at home, Justine can be found either in the car (driving kids around), enjoying time with friends, at the Bay, exercising with the beloved Pineapple Fitness, or walking the dog.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, no matter your gender - so share it with all of your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nFor this event we'll be gathering at the NewyTechPeople office in their event space at 24 Lindus Street, Wickham.\n\nThere will be pizza and refreshments provided, please let Arden or Sarah know of any dietaries you have beforehand.",

      "title": "data.FEB <- Double episode: Staircase & Measuring strings",
      "description": "We're starting 2023 with a bang: **Two short talks** 💥\n\n**Riley Clement: Staircase** is a python package for data analysis built upon pandas and numpy. It exists as part of the [pandas ecosystem](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ecosystem.html#staircase) to enable modelling, manipulation and analysis with mathematical step functions. It has found plenty of applications at Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordinator where Riley was working when it was created. In this talk Riley will touch on some of these applications (while keeping it light on python), and try and convince you that sometimes it's useful to \"think in stepfunctions\".\n\n**Ant Desmet: How long is my piece of string?** In this talk, we will try to measure an actual piece of string (*really* !). However you'll soon discover it's all just an elaborate deception to talk about statistics... but in a fun way 🤓. We'll see the intuition behind confidence intervals, statistical significance, etc. Expect some props 🪄 and even a bit of audience participation 🙄😒\n\n**The Speakers**\n**Riley** is currently employed as an Optimization Engineer at Gurobi Optimization, and loves playing in prescriptive and predictive analytics. He has authored [staircase](https://www.staircase.dev), and its cousin [piso ](https://piso.readthedocs.io)(pandas interval set operations), and enjoys bringing modern software practices to the world of data analytics.\n\n**Ant** trained as an engineer, and lived in fear of Math throughout his degree😱. However, he had to confront his nemesis 👾🤺in order to graduate from his PhD 🎓. During the ensuing clash, he finally discovered that Math *is* fun, after all 🤓!\nHe then became a fairly decent data scientist 👨‍🔬 predicting when big, costly machines would fail. He currently works at Honeysuckle Health and does a fair bit of stats 🥰 to scientifically prove that health support programs work 🩺. While doing all of that, he turned to the dark side and became a manager 😕\n\nVENUE:\nNEW LOCATION!\nThe university's brand new Q building in Honeysuckle!\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\nIMPORTANT this is NOT the NewSpace building where we met last year.\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space. You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\nTIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\nFOOD: 🍕 + 🥤\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by NewyTechPeople\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n* 7:30pm: Close",
