      "title": "NCSG August 2023 | Chris Langton",
      "description": "G'day all! Welcome back to NCSG for 2023. This month we've got Chris showcasing how to get better security outcomes than DevSecOps by getting out of the way of the developers, while simultaneously empowering them even more than before and gaining real assurance.\n\nChris (stof) is primarily known for his consulting work in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, and Canberra. He embraces extreme challenges, whether it's conquering snowboarding, embarking on multi-day remote hiking, or diving into the world of data engineering (the hardest of all).\n\nBut in all seriousness Chris is heavily involved in security work, which he finds comparatively easy. He firmly believes that security work is accessible to anyone of a certain age, irrespective of their prior experience. For him, it's all about leveraging any experience working with people and organisations. While coding skills certainly come in handy, Chris emphasises that the foundation should always begin with interpersonal skills before delving into the technical aspects.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** August 30th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - bottom floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?

      "description": "For our September meeting, we will have Cole Cornford delivering his lock note talk from Cloud Security Summit 2023, looking at Application Security and securing your Kubernetes containers.\n\nWe'll be hosted out of MudBath Digital in Hunter Street.\n\nThere is some on street parking available in the vicinity and the closest public transport is the Honeysuckle light rail stop.\n\nWe'll be providing pizza, soft drink, water, beer and wine.\n\n**Agenda**\n\n* 6:00 - Doors open / drinks / pizza\n\n* 6:30 - Tech news\n\n* 6:45 - Cole Cornford\n\n* 7:45 - Drinks / pizza\n\n**The talk**\n\nContainers have radically transformed how organisations manage and deploy applications. Kubernetes has emerged as a leading platform for orchestrating these containers. However, as its usage soars, so do associated security risks.\n\nThis presentation will cover the following:\n\n- Delving into Kubernetes security basics and prevalent threats\n\n- Sharing strategies for fortifying Kubernetes clusters\n\n- Highlighting case studies of successful Kubernetes security practices.\n\n**About Cole**\n\nCole is the Founder and CEO of Galah Cyber, Australia’s leading Application Security consultancy. Cole founded Galah after working w/ internationally recognised organisations to plan, implement, and operate large-scale Application Security programs. Cole has been honored to be the Occasional Speaker for the University of Newcastle 2023 Graduation, founded the /NEW regional technology conference, and helps operate and guide the Newwwie Digital Community for technologists in the Hunter Region.\n\nCole is well known in the Australian security scene, having penned thought-provoking articles about software engineering with a security lens, and regularly presenting at BSides, AISA, and other engineering conferences around the country. Cole is the host of the Secured podcast, which focuses on the humans and business side of Cybersecurity, and is the father of two daughters, Monica and Xinni. He enjoys crushing Xinni at Mariokart, but waits patiently for when the student becomes the master.",

      "title": "data.SEP <- Richard Bean: Explaining bike share use worldwide with data & models",
      "description": "***Explaining Bike Share use worldwide by Environmental and Sociodemographic Factors***\n\n🗣️**Talk Description**: I started collecting bike share data soon after the Brisbane CityCycle bike sharing scheme completed station rollout in April 2012. Over the next 10 years I extended the data collection to dozens of other schemes. During the same period, many high-resolution data sets became publicly available, covering land use data, bicycle infrastructure data, elevation, and weather data. Using these I built models to explain how the interaction of many factors affect bike share and e-scooter use worldwide. These include: temporal variables, the natural and built environment, weather, gender and age of users, gradient, and electric versus \"classic\" bikes. The findings have implications for barriers facing cyclists and policy changes which might help cycling uptake.\n\n🎙️**Speaker Bio**: Richard is a data scientist working at the University of Queensland. He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Energy and has worked for more than 10 years in energy related roles (ROAM Consulting, AEMO, Redback Technologies) as well as in universities in Australia and Iran. He has also published extensively in bioinformatics, transport, combinatorics and classical cryptography. He has written many articles about his findings on \"The Conversation\" website.\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University's Q building in Honeysuckle\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space. You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place, and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\n\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7\n\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\n🕠 TIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\n\nFOOD: 🍕 + 🥤\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by NewyTechPeople\n\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n\n* 7:30pm: Close",
