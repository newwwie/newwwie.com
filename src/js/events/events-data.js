Martin will then turn to data science in astrophysics and how we are gathering very large peta-scale datasets to study the Universe in the time-domain. Martin will also showcase some work using state space models as classifiers for “Gravitational Wave Afterglows” which are the newest and sexiest explosions from black-hole and neutron-star binary mergers, and were predicted by Einstein over 100 years ago\n\n🎙️**Speaker Bio**: Dr Martin Bell has a PhD in Astrophysics and has held post doctoral positions at the University of Sydney and CSIRO, including a five-year tenure as a lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney (in Astrophysics / Data Science). Currently he is employed as a full stack data scientist at the University of Newcastle working with the senior executive. His research background is a combination of high-performance computing, data science and time-series analysis applied to the studies of explosive and dynamic objects in the Universe. In his current role he applies Machine Learning and a broad plethora of data science techniques across the University data ecosystem to drive the best performance in research, teaching and external rankings.\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University's Q building in Honeysuckle\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.
