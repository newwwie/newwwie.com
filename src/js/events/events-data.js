      "title": "data.SEP <- Richard Bean: Explaining bike share use worldwide with data & models",
      "description": "***Explaining Bike Share use worldwide by Environmental and Sociodemographic Factors***\n\n🗣️**Talk Description**: I started collecting bike share data soon after the Brisbane CityCycle bike sharing scheme completed station rollout in April 2012. Over the next 10 years I extended the data collection to dozens of other schemes. During the same period, many high-resolution data sets became publicly available, covering land use data, bicycle infrastructure data, elevation, and weather data. Using these I built models to explain how the interaction of many factors affect bike share and e-scooter use worldwide. These include: temporal variables, the natural and built environment, weather, gender and age of users, gradient, and electric versus \"classic\" bikes. The findings have implications for barriers facing cyclists and policy changes which might help cycling uptake.\n\n🎙️**Speaker Bio**: Richard is a data scientist working at the University of Queensland. He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Energy and has worked for more than 10 years in energy related roles (ROAM Consulting, AEMO, Redback Technologies) as well as in universities in Australia and Iran. He has also published extensively in bioinformatics, transport, combinatorics and classical cryptography. He has written many articles about his findings on \"The Conversation\" website.\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University's Q building in Honeysuckle\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space. You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place, and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\n\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7\n\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\n🕠 TIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\n\nFOOD: 🍕 + 🥤\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by NewyTechPeople\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n* 7:30pm: Close",
