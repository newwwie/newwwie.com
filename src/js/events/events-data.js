      "title": "data.NOV <- Jackson Clarke: Data-Driven Solutions from First Principles",
      "description": "***Data-Driven Solutions from First Principles***\n\n🗣️**Talk Description**: This is a talk by example and anecdote. The general theme is to share how a group of mathematicians and physicists have brought (and are bringing) first principles approaches driven by the scientific method to bear to solve industry problems in innovative ways. It will cover topics ranging from designing and operating a scalable on-demand ensemble forecasting service, to building bespoke server clusters out of recycled bus shelters, and all manner of topics (and stories) in between.\n\n🎙️**Speaker Bio**: Jackson is a Novocastrian with undergraduate degrees in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Newcastle, and a Masters and PhD in Physics (phenomenological particle physics) from the University of Melbourne. He has been working to bring first principles data-driven approaches to life in industry since 2016 across sectors including engineering, construction, architecture, health, finance, property, commodities, banking, and energy. He is now back home in Newcastle working with a first-class team to establish Tentacle as the world's #1 prediction-as-a-service provider out of a factory unit in Redhead, ten minutes walk from the beach.\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University's Q building in Honeysuckle\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.

      "title": "Tech Trivia",
      "description": "Let's end the year on a great note. Once again, we're bringing the Newcastle tech community together for Newwwie Tech Trivia.\nKlee will go curate a list of questions that will be humorous, challenging and esoteric. You can expect questions on the news from the last year, tech history, among some edge case programming questions reminiscent of bad job interviews.\n\nOur venue will be the Camplify / NTP Office. We'll have plenty of food, drinks and prizes thanks to our sponsors, Saphi Engineering, Galah Cyber and Newy Tech People.\n\nThis is a team-based game, come with a team pre-formed or find one on the day. In past years our best teams have been people who happened to sit at a table together.\n\nWe'll have 3 rounds, each with their own prizes so if you need to arrive late or leave early, that's OK.\n\nDoors will open from 6:00 with drinks, food and time to find a team.\nThe first round starts at around 6:45.\n\nThis is an in-person only event.",
