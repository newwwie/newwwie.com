      title: "NCSG March 2024 | Empowering End-User Security",
      description:
        "Welcome all! This month we have Emily McRae, IT Risk & Cybersecurity veteran and the lead team member of nib Group's Service Desk presenting on enabling users to make security-savvy decisions everyday!\n\nIn today's digital age, cybersecurity has become a crucial aspect of our everyday lives. From personal data protection to safeguarding sensitive business information, the need for strong cybersecurity measures is more pressing than ever. However, despite the growing awareness of cybersecurity threats, many end users still struggle to understand and implement effective security practices.\n\nThis presentation aims to address this gap by exploring strategies for making cybersecurity accessible to end users. We will delve into the importance of user-friendly approaches in cybersecurity education, tools, and policies. By empowering end users with the knowledge and resources they need, we can enhance overall security posture and mitigate risks effectively.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** March 27th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?
