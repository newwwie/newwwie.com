      "title": "July: Paul Usher + Matt Goldman",
      "description": "We'll have two speakers for our July meeting;\n**Matt Goldman** from SSW will be travelling up from Sydney to give us an overview of passwordless authentication.\n\n**Paul Usher** from DevExpress will be flying down from Brisbane to give a talk on an as-yet-to-be-decided topic.\nBoth of these speakers are great speakers who have spoken at events and conferences worldwide.\n\nWe'll be hosted and sponsored by SSW Newcastle.\n\n**Talk 1: Beyond Passwords: The future (and present) of authentication**\n\nWe all know passwords are not fit for purpose, and we're slowly making our way to a \"post-password\" world. Passwords are a problem for security, convenience, and accessibility, and the future of authentication won't involve passwords at all.\n\nThere are already many options available to take passwords out of the picture for your authentication scenarios. We're all used to our phones and computers letting us login with our faces or fingers, and organisations like the FIDO alliance are building the foundations of the password-free future.\n\nBy using existing and well-established technologies, we can provide secure, convenient, passwordless authentication for our users. In fact, in many cases, a password is the worst possible option. Not every interaction has a keyboard or biometric sensor available, and many don't even involve a user at all.\n\nIn this talk, Matt Goldman gives us a glimpse of the future, showing how developers can use familiar technologies to minimise, or even eradicate, the use of passwords, paving the way for safe, secure, and seamless authentication using the technology already in our hands.\n\nBio: [https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman)\n\n**Talk 2:**",
