      "title": "NCSG, March 2022 | Andrew Newnham, Introspectus",
      "description": "Let's try this again! Andrew was our originally scheduled speaker for February, but had to pull out due to unforeseen circumstances. Lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place, so we'll be fine ðŸ¤ž\n\n**Talk synopsis:**\n\n*Since June 2017, the Australian Signals Directorate have published the ASD Essential Eight Maturity Model. The Essential Eight Maturity Model provides minimum security standards which private enterprise is recommended to follow, and which Government Departments must follow.*\n\n*These standards cover security enforcement at a technical level, as well as non-technical policy and procedures which must be followed to be compliant.*\n\n*Andrew will discuss the challenges that Introspectusâ€™ customers have had implementing the Essential Eight and what things Introspectus looks for when determining what Maturity Level an organisation is.*\n*This talk is ideal for those who have been told that they need to start complying with ASDâ€™s Essential 8 but donâ€™t know where to start.*\n\n**About Andrew:**\n\n*Andrew has been in the IT industry for more than 20 years. He has seen corporate networks transform from small little offices with a server under a desk in the backroom to massive global corporate networks.*\n\n*He has worked in Infrastructure and Software Development and has skills in securing large systems, and working with very large data sets.*\n*He started building the first prototypes of Introspectus back in 2014. Since then, he has built up a software development team to expand the project into the Introspectus Product.*\n\n*Outside of computers, he is a massive aviation geek and will happily talk about airplanes for hours. He also loves boats and car racing, albeit as a spectator not a driver. Chances are if it has an engine Andrew will like it.*\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: 24th March, 2022\nTime: 18:00-20:00ish (or until we go to the pub)\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - seminar space on Level 2\nFood: Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf youâ€™re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please donâ€™t attend.

      "title": "April - We're Back - Cole Cornford - Klee Thomas",
      "description": "We're back!\nIt's been about a year since we last met up in person and we're excited to get back to it. This month weâ€™re meeting at Mudbath Digitalâ€™s (https://mudbath.com.au) Newcastle office.\n\nWe have 2 speakers lined up.\nRegulars speaker Klee Thomas will be talking about \"Allow lists suck: protecting staging in a zero trust environment with Cloudflare workers\" and Cole Conford founder of Galah Cyber will be giving a talk on hacking Zelda Ocarina of Time.\n\n\\#\\# Breaking the Ocarina \\- the intersection of app sec and gaming\nCole will be talking about an intersection of two passions that he has, AppSec and Zelda Ocarina of Time. Zelda OoT is almost 25 years old and has had extensive security research undertaken on it. Why? For speedrunning and fun. This talk will introduce you to both simple and complex bugs in OoT, how they were discovered, what their impact is, and how this is all related to helping you build secure applications.\n\nCole is the Director of Galah Cyber, a specialist Application Security consultancy. Cole has worked in the technology, finance, telco, and government sectors previously doing AppSec. He enjoys helping to grow the local Newcastle Tech scene, playing Elden Ring, and calling his French bulldog Rocco a chunky piggy doggy.\n\n\\#\\# IP Allow lists suck: Secure your staging environments in a 0 trust network with Cloudflare workers \\-\\- Klee Thomas\nProtecting your staging environment with an IP address allow list is becoming more and more unrealistic in the age of remote working. Why would you require that your employees are on a VPN so that they can do their job? Why would you require that your partner companies' employees all have to use a limited set of addresses? Implementing a solution that allows access to staging in a zero-trust environment is actually not all that hard at all. Once itâ€™s in place youâ€™ll be able to grant and revoke access to your staging environments on a per user basis.\nIn this talk, Iâ€™ll take you through protecting your staging environment in a zero-trust world using Cloudflare Workers and Auth0.\n\nKlee is a Software Developer and organiser of the Newcastle Coders Group. He is an Agile, Clean Code and Craftsmanship advocate who loves to talk about what we can do to build better quality, maintainable software. Outside of software development fan of Martial Arts, Netflix and spending time with his wife and cats.\n\n**Location:** Mudbath Digital 8/710 Hunter Street Newcastle\n\n**Parking:** Parking spaces nearby on street and at the spotlight parking garage.\n\n**Sponsors:** Saphi Engineering\n\n**Agenda**\n\n* 5:45 - Doors open\n* 6:00 - News\n* 6:20 - Talk 1\n* 7:20 - Pizza\n* 7:49 - Talk 2\n* 8:40 - End",

      "description": "This April, hear from fellow Novocastrian, Director & Founder of Safe Gauge Luke Dawson.\n\nLuke grew up in the Hunter Valley and went to Maitland Grossmann High finishing in 2010. As a field service technician specialising in Caterpillar equipment, some of the machines Luke was responsible for maintaining were large dump trucks, bulldozers, excavators and wheel loaders. Throughout the 8 years working in the mining industry, Luke had a few ideas on completing common high-risk jobs much safer and more efficiently.\n\n[Safe Gauge ](https://safegauge.com.au/)has gone from strength to strength over the past few years, securing investment and scaling rapidly.\n\nJoin us on April 7th from 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm at The Stag & Hunter Hotel.
