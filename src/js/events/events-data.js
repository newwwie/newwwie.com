      "description": "For our August meeting we'll be talking about containers and orchestrating them with Kuberneties.\n\nWe'll be hosted by MudBath with sponsorship from Saphi.\n\n**The Talk:** Containers are confusing and there are a few misconceptions about what containers are. In this presentation Alister will demonstrate what containers are, what they aren't and how to reason about them. Once you understand what containers are, you'll have a better time building and running them. Bring along your laptop with docker and Kubernetes installed and you can try out the commands yourself on the night!\n\n**About Alistair:** I'm a senior software developer working at the Greater Bank where I primarily work on backend services, using Kotlin, deployed on Kubernetes. I've been doing software for over 25 years, so these days i'm \"old man who yells at clouds\"\n\n**Getting to the event:**\nMubath is located in 710 Hunter street in the 2nd floor of the building.\nThere is some on street parking available.\nThe closest public transport is trains from the Newcastle Interchange, there is a bus stop at the venue.",

      "title": "data.AUG <- Stats, ML and ops: presented by Team HH",
      "description": "This month, there's something for everyone with our Trio of Analytics Dips 😋, courtesy of Team Honeysuckle Health:\n\n* **Stats**: Imagine you organised a great big initiative, and it just concluded yesterday. That initiative could be your marketing campaign, staff training course, health intervention, etc.\nYou feel like things went well, but you wish you'd thought about *proving* the success of your initiative with *hard numbers*. But it's all too late, now that the intervention is complete... right?\nFear not! We'll talk about observational studies and look at how they can quantify the success of your intervention, even *after the fact*. ⚖\n* **Machine Learning**: Sometimes you need to compare things that you can't quite measure directly 📏.\nTake, for instance, the cost of the *same* surgery. Though the same procedure was delivered, the price will still depend on the patient's age, where they live, their medical history and risks. How can we tell if a surgery was overpriced... when no two are different? Answer in this talk: it involves ML 🧠\n* **Ops**: Making all of this come together, at scale, for real-time insights.\n\nVENUE:\nThe university's brand new Q building in Honeysuckle!\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nIMPORTANT this is NOT the NewSpace building where we met last year.\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space. You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\n\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7\n\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\nTIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\n\nFOOD: 🍕 + 🥤\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by Newy Tech People\n* Please advise dietary requirements in RSVP\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n* 7:30pm: Close",
