      "description": "**🗣️Talk Description:**\n\nWould you believe we have **THREE** industry professionals that have all built databases from scratch here in Newcastle? Join us for this panel event where we ask them about the motivations, the journey, the hurdles.\n\n**🎙️Panelist Bios:**\n\n**Stephen Young:**\nSteve has been thrown so many buzzwords and so much jargon in his varied bio and tech career that he decided he needed to create a graph database to manage them. He now uses his company's GraphBase product to solve complex data and knowledge representation problems for fun and (sometimes) profit.\n\n**Geoffrey Campey:**\nGeoffrey is a life-long nerd and reformed lawyer, working as a consultant in digital, mobile and online forensics. He decided to build a graph database product over a bottle of delicious chardonnay at the Commonwealth Hotel. It was harder than he thought. He failed. But it makes for a great story!\n\n**Andrew Goodwin:**\nAndrew is an engineer who has worked extensively with spatial and time series data analytics. In 2015 he started building a time series database called AtriumDB which is focused specifically at storing and managing high frequency physiological signals collected in an intensive care unit. This database has since been released as an open source project and is installed in numerous hospitals around the world. The software facilitates analysis of the signals in a high performance computing environment, and also supports the training and deployment of ML models on live streaming data.\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University's Q building in Honeysuckle, Level 2\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7](https://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7)\n\n* We will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.\n* You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place, and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\n* If you can't get in, please signal to the security guard that should be at the front desk that your here for the meetup.\n\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7](https://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7)\n\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\n🕠 TIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\n\nFOOD: 🍕 + 🥤\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by NewyTechPeople\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n* 7:30pm: Close\n* 7:30pm+: [Unofficially] anyone wanting to continue chatting, we usually head to [Honeysuckle Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z3e4JvSvYWb6quwn6) which is a short walk from the venue.",

      "description": "**🗣️Talk Description:** On this journey, we will discuss much about the human brain as this mystical, seemingly unattainable model. We'll also touch on the flaws and architectural design limitations of current artifical neural networks. Next will be a homage to spiking neural networks highlighting their more fantastic abilities juxtaposed to their curses. Finally we can cover some ground on where creativity stems from, and why we shouldn't let engineers model the brain. As a disclaimer the talk itself is going to be quite dense and probably a little too broad. However that's a consequence of adhd and I apologize for nothing.\n\n**🎙️Speaker Bio:** \"Hi.
