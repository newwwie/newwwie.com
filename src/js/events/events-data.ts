      "title": "NCSG June 2024 | Threat Hunting: The End to End",
      "description": "Hi all!\n\nThis month we're lucky to have Brody along to talk about threat intelligence, from end to end!\n\n**Speaker bio:**\nBrody is currently serving as Director of OverWatch, CrowdStrike's threat hunting service. He joined CrowdStrike over ten years ago as an Intrusion Analyst after a brief stint with the Department of Defence and has been there ever since. Brody has been at the front lines of the Crowdstrike journey from startup, through IPO, to market leader today and has developed and shaped the tools and workflows OverWatch uses to this day.\n\n**Talk synopsis:**\nThere is very little consensus in the industry about the definition of \"threat hunting\"\nCome and learn what that phrase means at CrowdStrike and how OverWatch leverages the telemetry from CrowdStrike's EDR product to deliver a threat hunting service at enormous scale while being both a producer and a consumer of high quality threat intelligence.\n\nThis talk will explain our telemetry and detections pipeline, outline key concepts and workflows enabling our threat hunting service, and illustrate how we produce and consume threat intelligence.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** June 26th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?

      "description": "We are back in July with Stephen G giving us his experiences working with Rust and WASM and Stephen Y giving us a talk about graphs in software.\n\nStephen Ys talk will cover how a combination of the Rust memory checker, type system and macros makes web development easier, when compared with other single language front and backends like typescript/nodejs, and why Stephen started teaching Rust to primary school children. http://rustycc.com.au.\n\nStephen G's talk will cover Graphs and graph databases: what makes them useful, some popular use cases, some interesting edge cases, and the roles they can play supporting Generative AI.\n\nWe'd like to thank our sponsors\n\n* Mudbath\n* Saphi Engineering\n* Newy Tech People",
