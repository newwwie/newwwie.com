      "title": "WGDPTech Meet-up: Living Authentically in a Stereotyped society",
      "description": "In August, we'll hear from Jacqui Andronicos on Living Authentically in a Stereotyped society.\n\n**The Talk:**\nLiving authentically in a society that imposes rigid roles and stereotypes is a constant challenge that women and gender-diverse individuals are well aware of, especially in fields traditionally dominated by cisgender white men, such as tech. From being told that women shouldn‚Äôt work or should be subservient to men, to the very existence of gender-diverse people being questioned, we face numerous societal \"shoulds\" and \"shouldn‚Äôts.\" These pressures don‚Äôt just apply to us as groups but also shape our individual lives and identities. On top of that, there are the stories we tell about ourselves.\n\nDrawing from the past two years of my life, I will share my journey to self-acceptance as a trans woman, diversifying my social circle, breaking my internal stories and embracing new hobbies I never would have seen myself doing like ultimate frisbee. I will discuss the importance of flexible minds and the benefits of being open to new experiences, the challenges of breaking free from societal and internal messaging, and the empowerment that comes from living authentically and being open. I will also touch on how these personal transformations have influenced my professional life in tech, highlighting the interconnectedness of personal and professional growth.\n\n**The Speaker:**\nJacqui started as a Software Engineer and now works as a Data Warehouse Engineer at Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordinator (HVCCC) and is passionate about diversity and inclusion in tech as well as the wider world. Over the past two years, Jacqui has undergone a profound personal transformation, embracing her identity as a trans woman and exploring new hobbies and interests. She is actively involved in various communities, including ultimate frisbee, swordcraft, and book clubs. Jacqui's journey of self-acceptance and her commitment to living authentically inspired her to share her experiences and insights with others. As a committee member and treasurer for Pie Wagon and the Sugar Magnolias ultimate clubs, she is dedicated to promoting inclusivity and fostering a supportive culture.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nDon't forget our 2024 location! We'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 9 Downie St, Maryville NSW for this event.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone. We provide food, so let us know of any allergies :)",
