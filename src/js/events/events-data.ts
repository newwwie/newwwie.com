      "description": "In November we'll be at the SSW office with [Matt Parker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattparkerdev/) introducing us to Photino a tool for building native cross platform apps using web technologies and showing us how to use it to build real world apps using Blazor.\n\nWe'll have pizza and drinks thanks to our sponsors:\n\n* [SSW](https://www.ssw.com.au/)\n* [Saphi Engineering. ](https://saphi.engineering)\n\nWe'll be hosted out of the SSW Newcastle offices.,\nParking: There is parking next to the Newcastle Museum.\nPublic Transport: The Civic tram stop is outside the SSW office.\n\n**About the talk:**\nAre you a Blazor developer wishing you could build cross-platform desktop apps (yes, even for Linux!) with familiar syntax? Join us to explore Photino, a lightweight framework that brings Blazor to the desktop with direct access to desktop APIs like file system access and multithreading. We’ll compare options like Electron, MAUI and Avalonia, then dive into a live example to show how quickly you can build a Blazor desktop app using Photino—no complex setups or new frameworks required!",

      "description": "**🗣️Talk Description:** On this journey, we will discuss much about the human brain as this mystical, seemingly unattainable model. We'll also touch on the flaws and architectural design limitations of current artifical neural networks. Next will be a homage to spiking neural networks highlighting their more fantastic abilities juxtaposed to their curses. Finally we can cover some ground on where creativity stems from, and why we shouldn't let engineers model the brain. As a disclaimer the talk itself is going to be quite dense and probably a little too broad. However that's a consequence of adhd and I apologize for nothing.\n\n**🎙️Speaker Bio:** \"Hi. My name is Jacob Saunders, and I have been aggressively failing (and learning) for the last 10 years. I have failed at many things, ranging from McDonald's crew person, to professional battery builder all the way over to pure mathematician. These are my stories...\"\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University's Q building in Honeysuckle\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7](https://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7)\n\n* We will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.\n* You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place, and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\n* If you can't get in, please signal to the security guard that should be at the front desk that your here for the meetup.\n\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7](https://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7)\n\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n\nONLINE: At the request of the speaker we will setup a zoom link for those that want to join remotely.
