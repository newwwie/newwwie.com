# newwwie.com

The source for [newwwie.com](https://newwwie.com). The project is really barebones to allow for a new member to not be lost in tooling and encourage contributions.

It takes a community to build the community.

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/newwwie/newwwie.com
cd newwwie.com
npm install
npm run dev
```

For more information please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This includes adding meetup groups and community listings.
