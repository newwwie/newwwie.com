This month we've got Chris showcasing how to get better security outcomes than DevSecOps by getting out of the way of the developers, while simultaneously empowering them even more than before and gaining real assurance.\n\nChris (stof) is primarily known for his consulting work in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, and Canberra. He embraces extreme challenges, whether it's conquering snowboarding, embarking on multi-day remote hiking, or diving into the world of data engineering (the hardest of all).\n\nBut in all seriousness Chris is heavily involved in security work, which he finds comparatively easy. He firmly believes that security work is accessible to anyone of a certain age, irrespective of their prior experience. For him, it's all about leveraging any experience working with people and organisations. While coding skills certainly come in handy, Chris emphasises that the foundation should always begin with interpersonal skills before delving into the technical aspects.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** August 30th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - bottom floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\.

Kubernetes has emerged as a leading platform for orchestrating these containers. However, as its usage soars, so do associated security risks.\n\nThis presentation will cover the following:\n\n- Delving into Kubernetes security basics and prevalent threats\n\n- Sharing strategies for fortifying Kubernetes clusters\n\n- Highlighting case studies of successful Kubernetes security practices.\n\n**About Cole**\n\nCole is the Founder and CEO of Galah Cyber, Australia’s leading Application Security consultancy. Cole founded Galah after working w/ internationally recognised organisations to plan, implement, and operate large-scale Application Security programs. Cole has been honored to be the Occasional Speaker for the University of Newcastle 2023 Graduation, founded the /NEW regional technology conference, and helps operate and guide the Newwwie Digital Community for technologists in the Hunter Region.\n\nCole is well known in the Australian security scene, having penned thought-provoking articles about software engineering with a security lens, and regularly presenting at BSides, AISA, and other engineering conferences around the country. Cole is the host of the Secured podcast, which focuses on the humans and business side of Cybersecurity, and is the father of two daughters, Monica and Xinni.

Over the next 10 years I extended the data collection to dozens of other schemes. During the same period, many high-resolution data sets became publicly available, covering land use data, bicycle infrastructure data, elevation, and weather data. Using these I built models to explain how the interaction of many factors affect bike share and e-scooter use worldwide. These include: temporal variables, the natural and built environment, weather, gender and age of users, gradient, and electric versus "classic" bikes. The findings have implications for barriers facing cyclists and policy changes which might help cycling uptake.\n\n🎙️**Speaker Bio**: Richard is a data scientist working at the University of Queensland. He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Energy and has worked for more than 10 years in energy related roles (ROAM Consulting, AEMO, Redback Technologies) as well as in universities in Australia and Iran. He has also published extensively in bioinformatics, transport, combinatorics and classical cryptography. He has written many articles about his findings on "The Conversation" website.\n\n🏢 **Venue**: University\'s Q building in Honeysuckle\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.
